AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application with connected RDS
====================================================

Creates an Elastic Beanstalk application and environment in a dedicated VPC and attached RDS Cluster using Terraform

![AWS Scheme](./docs/aws-scheme.jpg)

# Dependencies
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Domain Name](https://godaddy.com/)
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

# Assumptions
* You already signed up for an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* You already set up [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* You already created an SSH keypair on your local machine.

# AWS Prerequisites
At this time there is no automatic provisioning for a given domain name in your AWS account. So the prerequisite is that you already set up your domain name in Route 53 and created a wildcard SSL certificate using ACM. You'll need the ARN of the SSL certificate. 

# Provisioning resources using Terraform
Once you set up and fulfill all prerequisites your good to go for provisioning resources on AWS using Terraform.
## Get prepared
1. Clone this repo using: `git clone git@github.com:katunch/terraform-aws-elasticbeanstalk-application-stack.git`
2. Copy `terraform.tfvars.sample` to `terraform.tfvars` and adjust the variables to your needs.

There are more variables which can be set. Please refer to `./vars.tf` for further information.

## Get things ready
Run the following commands to provision the resources in your AWS account.
1. `terraform init` to install all modules and deppendencies
2. `terraform plan` to get an overview what happens in your AWS account. 
3. `terraform apply` will create the resources.
